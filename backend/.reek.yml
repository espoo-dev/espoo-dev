### Generic smell configuration

detectors:
  # You can disable smells completely
  IrresponsibleModule:
    enabled: false

  # You can use filters to silence Reek warnings.
  # Either because you simply disagree with Reek (we are not the police) or
  # because you want to fix this at a later point in time.
  NestedIterators:
    exclude:
      - "MyWorker#self.class_method" # should be refactored
      - "AnotherWorker#instance_method" # should be refactored as well
  TooManyStatements:
    exclude:
      - "Users::SessionsController#create"
      - "Seeds"
  TooManyMethods:
    exclude:
      - "Seeds"
  InstanceVariableAssumption:
    exclude:
      - "Seeds"
  TooManyInstanceVariables:
    exclude:
      - "Seeds"
  # A lot of smells allow fine tuning their configuration. You can look up all available options
  # in the corresponding smell documentation in /docs. In most cases you probably can just go
  # with the defaults as documented in defaults.reek.yml.

### Directory specific configuration

# You can configure smells on a per-directory base.
# E.g. the classic Rails case: controllers smell of NestedIterators (see /docs/Nested-Iterators.md) and
# helpers smell of UtilityFunction (see docs/Utility-Function.md)
#
# Note that we only allow configuration on a directory level, not a file level,
# so all paths have to point to directories.
# A Dir.glob pattern can be used.
